# Room-With-View

The sample app stores a list of words in a Room database and displays it in a RecyclerView. The app is bare bones but sufficiently complex 
that you can use it as a template to build upon.

Works with a database to get and save the data, and pre-populates the database with some words.
Displays all the words in a RecyclerView in MainActivity.
Opens a second activity when the user taps the + button. When the user enters a word, adds the word to the database and the list.
